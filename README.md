# 3D-Projection

## History and Purpose

This is a personal side-project I completed as an undergraduate student after deciding I wanted to learn more about how three-dimensional spaces are displayed on a two-dimensional screen.  I did some research into the mathematics behind 3D projection, and as a way to showcase the knowledge I acquired--to myself and to others--I created this wireframe prototype from scratch, using the rudimentary Java Swing UI tools.

N.B.  This project was intended to be only a proof-of-concept, and in that regard I consider it a success.  More sophisticated UX considerations would be an obvious next step, but they were not the primary goal at the time, hence the crude input mechanics.  That being said, I think the code itself does a good job of showcasing my coding style and organization.

## Usage

After launching, set focus in the popup window by manually clicking anywhere in the window.  Then, freely explore the 3D space using the E, S, D, and F keys to move, and the J and L keys to turn.
